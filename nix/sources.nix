# Where every dependency of this repository lives.
#
# nixidae is the umbrella that holds it, and the umbrella owns every source.
# Inside the umbrella that is the checkout two directories up. Outside it,
# the umbrella is fetched, and this working copy is put in place of the copy
# that came down with it. Either way the answer is the same one, so a build
# here and a build from the umbrella agree.
#
# A plain tarball is enough. The umbrella records every revision in
# nix/sources.lock, a file in its own tree, and the working copies beside it
# are ignored rather than committed, so a fetch that brings down none of them
# still resolves all of them.
#
# `..` from a store path leaves the store root, and Nix refuses that rather
# than answering false: "'nix' is too short to be a valid store path". So ask
# only when this checkout is not itself in the store.
#
# `flake.nix` is a second door for a consumer who uses flakes, and it hands
# `default.nix` its own nixpkgs rather than coming through here.  Everything
# else -- CI, a developer, the umbrella -- takes this one.

  # `builtins.tryEval` does not catch it -- measured, not assumed -- so the
  # question has to be avoided rather than caught.
  #
  # A bare store path is exactly `/nix/store/` plus one component. Anything

  # precisely the case where the umbrella is the thing in the store and this
  # checkout is inside it.

  # Being in the store does not mean the umbrella is absent. An earlier

  # took the fetch below instead of the umbrella it shipped inside.

  # UMBRELLA_REV names it, and that is what makes two jobs of one CI run
  # agree. `ci/walkback.sh` computes it: the umbrella that locks the nearest
  # landed ancestor of HEAD, read from the umbrella remote refs named
  # `refs/umbrella/vivarium/*`. `umbrella mark` publishes them.
  #
  # Before umbrella 0.1.0 this fell back to an unlocked
  # `github:nixidae/nixidae`, which resolves the head of the default branch at
  # evaluation time, every time `tarball-ttl` does not answer from cache. So
  # the same commit gave a different answer an hour later, with nothing here
  # changed and no lock moved. Measured 2026-09-16 by a consumer whose nixidae
  # pin had not moved since 2026-09-14 and whose render hash moved anyway,
  # twice. Issue Lillecarl/nanopynix#301.

  # **A file, and not a git ref, because only a file survives every way this
  # expression is read.** A tree that Nix fetched carries no `.git` and no
  # revision marker, so an expression inside it cannot learn its own revision
  # or its own url. Measured: `builtins.readDir` of a fetched tree lists the
  # source files and nothing else. A consumer that took this repository as
  # `github:Lillecarl/vivarium`, a release tarball, or a pull request from a
  # fork could not resolve a pin held in a ref. GitHub copies `refs/heads`
  # and tags to a fork, and not a custom ref namespace. A file is in the
  # tree, so every one of those reads it.
  #
  # It is also the only mechanism that works under `--pure-eval`, where
  # `builtins.getEnv` answers "". That is what lets a flake consumer resolve
  # a pinned umbrella rather than the moving head of a branch.

  # **It names the umbrella this commit was written against, and not the one
  # that locks this commit.** Those cannot be the same. The umbrella lock
  # holds this commit's hash, so a commit that held the lock's hash would
  # need a hash that contains itself. The earlier revision is the useful one
  # anyway: a build of this checkout overrides this repository with the
  # checkout, so the umbrella supplies every *other* source, and the revision
  # the work was done against is the one that supplied them.
  #
  # `builtins.match` rather than a trim helper, because it also rejects a
  # file that holds anything but a hash.

        umbrella 0.1.0 removed the arm that fell back to the head of the

        this repository rendered differently from one hour to the next.
